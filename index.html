                1.<b>Botox</b>: is a popular injectable treatment used to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on the face. It works by temporarily paralyzing the muscles that cause these wrinkles, resulting in smoother, more youthful-looking skin. <br>
                2.<b>Fillers</b>: Dermal fillers are injectable treatments that add volume and lift to the face, lips, and other areas to restore a youthful appearance. VitalityMD Medical Spa offers a range of dermal fillers, including Revanesse. <br>
                3.<b>Laser hair removal</b>: Laser hair removal is a non-invasive method for removing unwanted hair from various body areas.

                4.<b>Microneedling with Radiofrequency</b>: Microneedling is a minimally invasive treatment that uses a small device with tiny needles to create micro-channels on the skin to deliver custom cocktails & serums. Radiofrequency (RF) lifts & tightens skin, stimulates collagen and elastin production, leading to smoother, more even skin. <br>
                5.<b>Laser Genesis & IPL</b>: these non-ablative treatments are able to solve various skin issues with minimal to no downtime. Great for conditions such as acne rosacea, large pores, scars, pigment lesions, redness, acne, lines and more. <br>

It includes lymph drainage, detoxification, exfoliation, and dermal infusions of bio-active serums and boosters that can penetrate the skin to 1.4mm <b>WITHOUT NEEDLES</b>. <br>
                8.<b>Biologique Recherche Skin Treatments and Peels</b>: This line is known worldwide as the magic potion of the skincare world. With results sworn to be sent from heaven, in reality, the brand owes its product’s success to years of scientific research and a personalized skin analysis for each client. Recherche’s personalized treatments – whether for the face, body or scalp are equally suitable for both men and women. <br>
                9.<b>Exosomes</b>: Exosomes are the latest and most advanced treatment that can harness the power of over 2 billion stem cells. Exosomes are the cell communicators; they tell cells what to do and transfer numerous growth factors, cytokines and genetic materials that have shown signs of tissue repair and improving skin cells. <br>
                10.<b>PRP</b>: Cosmetic PRP, also known as Platelet-Rich Plasma, repairs your skin at the cellular level using your very own plasma. It contains a very high volume of platelets, inflammatory mediators and growth factors. <br>
